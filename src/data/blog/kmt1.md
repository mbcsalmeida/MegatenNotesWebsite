description: Kyuuyaku Megami Tensei notes.
---

These notes are based on mulsqi's route, Symm's notes and Jon's notes. It's a mish-mash of everyone's notes but I needed more info because this game drives me insane.

## Table of Contents

## Daedalus

Start+A to get through naming.

- Nakajima - All STR
- Yumiko - 4 VIT, rest INT

**Floor 8**
Grab chest (500 Macca). Spin 31 times in front of it and talk to Jack Frost to get 3k macca, 3k MAG and 10000 EXP.

Armors:

- 2x Combat Suit (コンバットス-ツ)

Weapons:

- Dagger (たんけん)

Equip (Y button):

- Nakajima - Combat Suit, Dagger
- Yumiko - Combat Suit

Config:

- Text Speed - Fast (はやい)
- Magic Re-ordering - ON

Fight random encounter to level up. For the first encounter avoid zombies.

- Nakajima - VIT
- Yumiko - INT

Recruit Gnome in fixed position. You'll want to recruit at least three demons for Minotaur so:

- Cancer, Stolas or Lemurian
- Nekomata in Floor 2
- Cerberus in Floor 1 (can be recruited later)

After recruiting nekomata, summon her below Nakajima - keep Nakajima on top.

Before Minotaur heal to full and summon Cerberus above Nakajima if you have it.

Fight Minotaur:

- Auto until healing is needed
- Use Mediama with Yumiko
- Recarm with Cerberus if Yumiko dies. She needs to live for Trastart (Can continue without it though)
- It is okay if some demons die. You can also Attack with everyone and defend with Yumiko for a safer but slower strategy instead of AUTO.
- Cast Mediama or use Jewels to heal up., use Cerberus to revive

Afterwards, walk to Valhalla to talk to Gar. Then traport back to the top of Daedalus tower. If Yumiko died, walk back to the elevator to go to 8F.

Save and heal.

Remove Nakajima's equipment and unsummon everyone except for one demon. Make sure Nakajima is on top. Go to 3F through the elevator.

Fight Bug:

- Attack, Defend, Defend until Nakajima dies.
- Defeat Bug with Agirama.

Grab Gar's shield. Then walk back and forth and defeat Bug until Yumiko gets to level 23.

- INT til 35, then points into Luck

Traport back when done and recarm with Cerberus or heal at the healer. Re-equip Nakajima.

Summon all demons and go back to 1F to go through Valhalla. Complete Gar's quest to get to Bien.

## Bien

Fight Medusa:

- Yumiko: Hanmahan, Others: Defend
- Nakajima - VIT til 35, Yumiko - VIT til 35

Go back to 2F.

Talk to Village Elder and save. Then go to Armors and buy:

- Ceramic Shield (セラミクスのたで)
- Fibre Suit (フアイバ-ス-ツ)
- Last item

Equip Ceramic Shield and Fibre Suit on Nakajima and the Suit on Yumiko. Heal if needed.

Go to Captain and choose move to Infini Palace.

Once you arrived, take the elevator to 1F then move straight forward.

## Infini Palace

The first goal is to arrive to the save point. This will be difficult as basically any encounter one-shots you if you fail to run away. Outlined below some recommended behavior to try to survive the encounters.

If you die, choose Continue. You'll be back in front of the save point in Bien already at the Infini Palace so just go back to 1F and try again.

Revive and save at the healer. Then try to grab the Daphne's Crown and then the Fog Armor and equip them on Yumiko and Nakajima, respectively. If Yumiko is alive, traport and then return any demons.

## Rotting Sea of Flames
