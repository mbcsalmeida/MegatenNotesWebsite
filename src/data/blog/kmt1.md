description: Kyuuyaku Megami Tensei notes.
---

These notes are based on mulsqi's route, Symm's notes and Jon's notes. It's a mish-mash of everyone's notes but I needed more info because this game drives me insane.
Maps are extracted from Symm's notes, thank you Symm.

Fight a random encounter to level up. For the first encounter avoid zombies.

Recruit Gnome in fixed position. You'll want to recruit at least three demons for Minotaur so:

- Cancer, Stolas or Lemurian

- Cerberus in Floor 1 (can be recruited later)

Fight Will-o-wisp and Zombies. Run away from the others.

![Daedalus 6F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/daedalus6F.png)

![Daedalus 5F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/daedalus5F.png)

![Daedalus 4F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/daedalus4F.png)

After recruiting nekomata, summon her below Nakajima - keep Nakajima on top.

Before Minotaur heal to full and summon Cerberus above Nakajima if you have it.

Fight Minotaur (166HP):
- Auto until healing is needed
- Use Mediama with Yumiko
- Recarm with Cerberus if Yumiko dies. She needs to live for Trastart (Can continue without it though)
- It is okay if some demons die. You can also Attack with everyone and defend with Yumiko for a safer but slower strategy instead of AUTO.
- Cast Mediama or use Jewels to heal up., use Cerberus to revive

Afterwards, walk to Valhalla to talk to Gar. 

![Valhalla 1F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/valhalla1F.png)

Then traport back to the top of Daedalus tower. If Yumiko died, walk back to the elevator to go to 8F.

Save and heal.

Remove Nakajima's equipment and unsummon everyone except for one demon. Make sure Nakajima is on top. Go to 3F through the elevator.

Traport back when done and recarm with Cerberus or heal at the healer. Re-equip Nakajima.

- Fibre Suit (フアイバ-ス-ツ)
- Last item

Equip Ceramic Shield and Fibre Suit on Nakajima and the Suit on Yumiko. Heal if needed.

Go to Captain and choose move to Infini Palace.

Once you arrived, take the elevator to 1F then move straight forward.

## Infini Palace

The first goal is to arrive to the save point. This will be difficult as basically any encounter one-shots you if you fail to run away. Outlined below some recommended behavior to try to survive the encounters.

If you die, choose Continue. You'll be back in front of the save point in Bien already at the Infini Palace so just go back to 1F and try again.

![Infini Palace 4F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/infini4F.png)

![Infini Palace 3F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/infini3F.png)

![Infini Palace 2F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/infini2F.png)

Revive and save at the healer. Then try to grab the Daphne's Crown and then the Fog Armor and equip them on Yumiko and Nakajima, respectively. If Yumiko is alive, traport and then return any demons.

## Rotting Sea of Flames

Encounter approach:
- Black Knight - Hamahan
- Rest - Escape

![Rotting Sea of Flames 2F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/sea2F.png)

![Rotting Sea of Flames 1F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/sea1F.png)

Collect Ruth's Bottle and traport or die if Yumiko is dead.

![Infini Palace 2F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/infini2F.png)

Walk back up to 2F to get to the elevator. Make sure to save at Infini Palace as you'll want to traport back here later, if you hadn't already. 

Collect the chest at 3F.

![Infini Palace 3F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/infini3F.png)

![Infini Palace 4F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/infini4F.png)

## Bien 2

![Bien 2F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/bien2F-2.png)

Go back to Bien 2F if you need to heal Yumiko's MP, she needs at least 56 MP for the next fight.

![Bien 4F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/bien4F-2.png)

Encounter approach:
- Escape
- Recruit Yomotsu-Shikome/Fungus/Vyi if you run into them and haven't yet

Then take the elevator to 4F (follow blue line) and fight the fixed Zoma encounter.
- Nakajima - Defend
- Yumiko - Hamahan

Follow the blue line until you fall into B1F.

![Bien B1F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/bienB1F.png)

Follow the blue line to go upstairs. Climb the stairs back up to 4F.

![Bien 4F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/bien4F-3.png)

Follow the green line and grab the Hinokagutsuchi. Equip it on Nakajima and unsummon any demons still in the party. You can now AUTO any random encounters.

Follow the yellow line which will have you fall down to the floor below. Turn around and take the stairs back to B1F.

Then take the elevator to the 4F and walk back to the fixed Zoma encounter.
- Nakajima - Attack
- Yumiko - Defend/Heal
- Change to Auto once you are confident you can survive
- Don’t let Nakajima’s HP fall below 160
- At level 47, remove Yumiko equipment and let her die, this way Nakajima gets more EXP and speed up the leveling (Zoma only gives 2k xp at level 47+)
- When Nakajima has 35 STR put points into luck
- When Vitality is full for Yumiko put points into luck

Re-equip Yumiko's equipment.
Once you reach lvl 49, take the elevator back to 2F.

![Bien 2F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/bien2F-2.png)

Fuse:
- (If no Yomotsu-Shikome/Fungus/Vyi) Gnome x Solas
- Yomotsu-Shikome x Cerberus = Thor

Use an Exorcism Herb ( せがきのれいやく) when you get to a new moon cycle (1 / 8) or close to it, so that you can avoid encounters through Valhalla. You can do this earlier as well. It lasts till the next new moon. 

Go to the Captain and choose to head to Valhalla

![Bien 1F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/bien1F-2.png)

## Valhalla

Head to B1F (Directly in front of you)

![Valhalla 1F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/valhallaB1F.png)

Head to the prison to free Rick and take Kali with you. Traport to be back in Infini Palace. If you saved in Bien, you'll have to move back to Infini Palace and go back to 2F

## Infini Palace 2

Save if you want (Do this if you saved in Bien 2F earlier). Summon Kali in front of Nakajima. Then climb back to 4F.

![Infini Palace 2F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/infini2F-2.png)

![Infini Palace 3F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/infini3F.png)

![Infini Palace 4F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/infini4F-2.png)

Talk to the skeleton and traport back to 2F. Head back to the Rotting Sea of Flames.

## Rotting Sea of Flames 2

![Rotting Sea of Flames 2F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/sea2F-2.png)

Collect the White Dragon Orb - make sure you're facing south after the teleport to grab the chest.
Traport back, heal, save - this is your last chance to save! - and head to 1F.

![Infini Palace 1F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/infini1F.png)

## Red Tower

Try to heal before Yumiko levels up. Use Auto in most battles, maybe better to talk to some
There is a chance of Paralysis on Yumiko, this is bad, kill her off then revive her with item

![Red Tower 1F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/redtower1F.png)

![Red Tower 2F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/redtower2F.png)

Collect the Sacred Bell on 2F

![Red Tower 3F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/redtower3F.png)

![Red Tower 4F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/redtower4F.png)

![Red Tower 5F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/redtower5F.png)

![Red Tower 6F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/redtower6F.png)

![Red Tower 7F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/redtower7F.png)

![Red Tower 8F](@/assets/images/kmt1maps/redtower8F.png)

Yumiko wants to have Max MP to start Lucifer fight, try to avoid using all of it. 

Fight Lucifer:
Apart from just doing insane party wide damage (Normal Attack or Bufudyne), Lucifer can also cast Curse which is an instant death ability, it is a low chance this works on a Human but it is possible that he can just kill your run like this. 
- Formation: Kali, Thor, Nakajima, Yumiko

First Turn
- Kali: Mediama
- Thor: Tarukaja
- Nakajima: Attack
- Yumiko: Defend

Rest of the fight
- Kali: Mediama / Defend / Attack
- Thor: Defend / Tarukaja
- Nakajima: Attack / Defend / Item
- Yumiko: Defend / Diarahan / Mediama / Item / Recarm
- Keep using Mediama with Kali till they are out of MP, then you can attack for extra damage
- Thor apply Tarukaja then just defend. 
- Nakajima should always attack unless he is below 200hp~ then defend and wait to be healed. He should also be used to Soma or Sacred Bell Yumiko. Can also use a Jewel to keep Yumiko healthy if need be
- Yumiko should defend untill Nakajima falls below 200HP then she should heal him. She will also need to heal herself and you can also heal Kali or other demons if the opportunity arises. Mediama can also be used as well. When her MP is low, have Nakajima use a Soma on her. If she dies (to curse, etc) use the Sacred Bell to revive her. You may also use Jewels if needed. What you do is mostly up to your judgement which will improve the more you fight this boss.
