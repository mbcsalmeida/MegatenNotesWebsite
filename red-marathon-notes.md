# Real World - Part 1

## STORY

The story takes place in July of the year 2000 after a mysterious black substance whose components cannot be examined has appeared out of nowhere and covered the skies all over the world, blocking the sunlight and making temperatures plummet. 

The game starts at the Harajuku district of Tokyo, which is currently experiencing snow in the middle of summer thanks to a temperature of -4°C (24,8°F). The main characters of the game are Setsuna Kai and Mirai Kaname, both orphans. Setsuna lives in an apartment with his younger brother Nagahisa Kai and Mirai is their next-door neighbor. For some time prior to the beginning of the game, both Setsuna and Mirai have been having dreams of a mysterious man telling them to gather keys and meet him at the depths of the Dark Palace. 

Red Book starts off with Mirai, the protagonist, leaving school before she's stopped by a boy named Yuuki who gives her a parcel. Another boy tries to steal it from her but recognises a jewel she wears as the "Messiah Eye" and takes it instead. Mirai runs after him up the rooftop and he reveals himself to be a Windfrag. Yuuki shows up and sacrifices himself to protect Mirai and she then uses the Devil Riser to defeat the Windrag. Then she talks to Zett who tells her to look after her father, who's in the demon world.

## STORY

Mirai arrives in Marbleland and heads to the Colosseum to find the White Messiah's Eye being displayed, the prize for the Colosseum contest. However, she gets stopped by Paimon, everyone's favourite Genshin Impact character, who wants to stop her from finding her father and tries to send her to the Abyss. Veil gets in the way of the attack and injured in the process. Paimon leaves and the Rasetsu at the door joins the party so we can enter the villages outside of the Colosseum to seek help in healing Veil.

In the village, we learn that the tribe that wins the contest will rule Marbleland and the Rasetsu want to win, claiming that the other tribes are too brute. We also learn that the other Devil Child has entered to win the Messiah's Eye as it seems like he's looking after his brother. Mirai meets another girl, Elegy, who tells her that the Demon King is lying to her and she's a fool for believing him.

At the final battle, we meet the other Devil Child, Setsuna, our neighbour. He tells Mirai that he's not seeking to destroy anything and simply looking for his brother. Mirai gets confused about what's the truth and decides to stop chasing after him and simply look for her father before they part ways. Then, as we won the contest, we choose one of the tribe leaders to become the new Lord of Marbleland and another to join us.

On the way, a gravestone speaks to us and the ghost of a woman pops up and tells us to look for Isis and keep the search for our father. 

In the pyramid, Mirai is told that Hresvelgr is looking for her. After meeting it, Hresvelgr says that Mirai has violated the Demon King's orders by letting Setsuna escape and should now be executed and both it and Souta, the Windfrag from the beginning of the game, attack. After being defeated, we head up to Isis' room and see her talking to Nagahisa, Setsuna's brother. He seems very upset to have learnt that his brother is a Devil Child and leaves. Isis then challenges us to a batle.

After we win, Isis tells Mirai of the ancient prophecy that says that before the apocalypse, one Devil Child will collect the eyes and the other the horns so together they have the keys to change fate and explains that by joining the eye with the horn, it makes a key.
