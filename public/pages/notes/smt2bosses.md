### Colosseum

![Valhalla - World Map](/images/smt2maps/VALHALLA1.png) ![Colosseum](/images/smt2maps/COLOSSEUM1.png)

Take the stairs up and mash through the announcer's speech.

Pick up the Fritz Helm `フリッツヘルム` (1), Legger Slum `レッガースラム` (2), Guyser Armor `カイザーアーマー` (3). Now you can defeat encounters to level up to level 9 - assign point to SPD `すばやさ`. After that, on any hero level up, assing points to INT. Afterwards, pick up Slicer `スライサー` (5) and equip everything. At NEW MOON or HALF MOON enter the fight. Name Daleth.

Fight Red Bear.

*   AUTO

Talk to Hiroko and say: NO -> NO. Head east to leave.

Leave the HANEDABUILDING and walk into the Messia Church to bookmark the Valhallla terminal. Leave and head to Madame's Mansion.

Name Beth. Say Yesはい and get Cerberus. Leave.

Near the entrance to the bridge, recruit Fairy High Pixie `ヨウセイ ハイピクシー` and Jirae Knocker `ジラエ ノッカー`. AUTO any other enemy. Head inside the bridge and head to the Slum City.

![Valhalla - World Map](/images/smt2maps/VALHALLA4.png) ![Slum City](/images/smt2maps/SLUMCITY-1.png)

![Slum City](/images/smt2maps/SLUMCITY-2.png)

In the Slum City, fight Mercurius:

*   AUTO
*   Hero - INT (until 9 INT)

Recruit an Alp, grab chest 01 - a Dis-Poison `ディポイズン` - and make sure you're level 12 before heading into the Mansion to fuse an Heqet:

*   Knocker `ノッカー` x Alp `アルプ` = Cait Sith `ケットシー`
*   Cait Sith x High Pixie `ハイピクシー` \= Heqet `ヘケト`

Head back through the bridge. Get a Cait Sith around Madame's Mansion. If there's room in the COMP and you find one, get Ihika or Sudama. If you reached 9 INT, put points into Speed.

It's more recommended to get a Sudama because it has Rakukaja which will be useful in battle, but a Ihika also works. After getting one of them, and while searching for Cait Sith, defeat Ihikas as they have a chance of dropping Dis-Poison's, which will be useful in the next segment.

Unequip Hiroko's Sword, Gun and Bullets and enter the Mansion. Name the interesting hair guy (it's us).

Recruit Jack Frost. Defeat Basilisk whenever possible. If you get poisoned, it's preferrable (though more dangerous) to heal in Battle. Use a Dis-Poison or Heqet's Posumudi `ポスムディ` to heal Aleph and Beth because the poison status reduces attack power.

If you have Jack Frost, summon it beforehand and use Rakukaja.

*   Sword, Rakunda (4x) -> Attack, Attack, Necroma - Heqet -> Tarukaja (2x) -> Attack, Diarahan - Herself, Attack
*   AUTO. Because Nyorai Statues are used automatically, YHVH will keep attacking and trying to kill you but you get automatically revived. The only fatal spell, the instant kill spell, is nullified by the necroma'd Heqet. Therefore, as long as you kill YHVH before you run out of rosaries, you can just AUTO and enjoy the show
