Most of the run relies on reflect strats. It's always advised to save before any fight because reflect strats can go wrong. Especially the last boss fight, as it is 3 fights back-to-back relying on getting the right attack reflected.

There's a glitch that allows you to go through locked or one-way doors in the game that's recurrently used in the run. To execute it, all you have to do is save in front of the door and reload the game.

Due to how demon affinity works in this game, there will be runs where you have more and less gems/items to gift to Leanan Sidhe. You want her to be at the highest possible affinity rate to be able to consistently use the HEY-HEY-HEY attack but life happens.

After the first half of the game, estoma stops working and the only way to avoid random encounters is to talk to them. There are some patterns that make certain demons consistently run away but it's still a very RNG heavy factor in the run.

There's some maps included in these notes but only some of them have guiding lines. Do familiarize yourself with the dungeons before running.

With this in mind, if you still want to run this game, enjoy the notes below.
