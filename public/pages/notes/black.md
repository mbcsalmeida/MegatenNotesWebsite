## House

Wake up, get the money from the cupboard behind you and leave your room. Get the Chakra Drinks from the fridge and talk to Nagahisa then attempt to leave only to get interrupted by a package arriving. Watch as your little brother gets kidnapped and say goodbye to his propaganda-less mind. Choose the second dialogue option to summon Cerberus, the cutscene is skippable.

Fight Jack Frost:
*   Cerberus uses Fireblaze

Change settings (fast text, animations off, voice acting off) and heal Cerberus with Dia. Go outside and defeat the other set of Jack Frosts the same way. Then leave the building and go talk to Set to get sent to Centerland.

Leave the hotel and go to the castle to talk to Lucifer who'll send you to the Iceland prison.

## Iceland

![frostown](/images/dcmaps/Iceland-Cave4.jpg)

Talk to the Ichigo Frost, Diana, and then talk to everybody demon except the top right one to recruit them. Afterwards, talk to Diana again to leave.

Fight any random encounters with Fireblaze and attack with other demons. Remember to heal after the fights with Dia.

Fight the demon that stops you on the way out.
*   Cerberus - Fireblaze and other demon - attack

Heal after the fight.

Enter the house and sell the 5x Chakra Drinks. Buy Estoma items until you have 2k left. For that purpose, you can grind a bit outside, especially if you didn't get any encounters on the way to the fight. You need to grind anyways so it's not that big of a timeloss anyways.

Defeat all encounters with Fireblaze and Attack.

Get to the house, talk to the first pot to the left and pay the 2x to get the demon, then talk to Diana. Leave and go to the shop next door to buy 1x Angel Wing.

Go to the VN shop and take the quiz for Devil Master, answers are:
*   1st quiz - 白いデビル、勝利の歌、電気を発する、６番、母親
*   2nd quiz - ぴちフロスト、ねむくなる、バク、クダギツネ、タロットカード

Head through the castle, go up the mount to get 1x Wind Magatama. On the cave, grab Yukion.

In Jack Frost Town, heal at the Hotel and summon the demons at the fusion mansion. Get the demon you got from the barrels on front.

On the way to the castle, use an estoma item. Walk to Hel's room.

Fight Hel:
*   Fire Blaze and Zio/Bufu against the Jack Frosts
*   Use the Wind Magatama against Hel, Cerberus can heal with Dia and attack normally while everybody else uses Magic

Transfer back, buy 1x Angel Wing, 3x attack capsules, 3x smoke bombs, 6x ice magatamas, 16x wind magatamas. If you still have money, buy more Wing Magatamas.

![frostown](/images/dcmaps/Marbleland4.jpg) ![castle](/images/dcmaps/Marbleland5.jpg)

Talk to the angel that will heal you, I forget which one it is, then leave the village and use an Angel Wing to go back to the Colosseum.

![castle](/images/dcmaps/Marbleland-Colosseum.jpg) ![castle](/images/dcmaps/Marbleland-Colosseum2.jpg)

Head inside the colosseum and reorder the party to have Jack Frost and Agathion first. If in any of the colosseum battles any demon dies you can revive them on the infirmary.

First battle:
*   Wind magatamas

Angel fights:
*   Bunbuku Chagama uses Zio, Agathion uses Zionga, Ichigo Frost uses Bufu and everybody else uses Wind Magatamas

Third angel fights

Before the next fight, go to computer and summon the other demon to the kinglyzer (press right, there'll be seperate 3 slots), heal and re-enter the colosseum. For the next two fights, use the same strategy.

Go to the computer and get the Yukion, re-order the party so it's second after Jack Frost.

Fight Mirai:
*   Bufula and Ice Magatamas and against Veil use Zionga/Zio

Mash A through the text and heal everybody before re-entering.

Abaddon fight:
*   Wind Magatama, bufula and zionga, everybody else use magic too

Afterwards, mash through the options, choosing the top one is the fastest. Then head back to the teleporter.

Heal right after, leave the shop and leave the arcade through the right exit. Go to the park.

![frostown](/images/dcmaps/Park-Shrine.jpg)

Head northeastward to meet nagahisa who you will fight. This is a big plot point but I'm sure you know this already. Shocking part, right? Anyways, the fight:
*   Auto
*   If Veil dies, revive it using the revival items like はんごうこう and use magic
*   Prioritize Veil being alive, be careful the Sphinxes are really strong

Revive demons with recarm and take the teleporter above the shrine.
