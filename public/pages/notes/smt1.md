Red Phantom: Azumi, Goblin, Hero, Pyro Jack
After the 1st turn of using Makakaja, use Hamayas with Hero.
Hero - INT

Zenki and Goki: Hero - INT
		Law Hero - MAG til 39, VIT til 6, SPD til 18
		Chaos Hero - INT

BEFORE TALKING TO HOMELESS MAN, RIGHT AFTER ENTERING THE POST APOCALYPTICAL WORLD:
Return Pyro Jack and use Cu Sith, use estoma, change party order:
Azumi, Goblin, Chaos Hero, Law Hero, Hero, Cu Sith

Sell weapons and buy Hinraya. If you got any good drops like the 1k sword or 1.25k Machine Gun you can sell them and skip exchanging the cash at the Old Man and go straight to the disco.

After talking to Ozawa for the first time, go to the Gaia:
4x こどくのざら (2nd option from the top), 1x Amulet (2x option from the bottom)

Ozawa: Remember to throw a charm!
	Hero - SPD
	Law Hero - VIT
Traestro, Shibuya. Summon Kushinada-Hime at the bottom.

Go to the healer, heal up Goblin and Cu Sith and buy 1x Tamagaeri and 3x Hamayas.

Don't get INT incense, after talking to the heroine get the MAG incense (door right at the end of the corridor to the left).

Wendingo: Hero - Holy Water

Arachne !!IMPORTANT FOLLOW EXACTLY!!
1st turn - Makakaja, Charm
2nd turn - Makakaja, Hamaya
3rd turn - Makakaja, Hamaya 
4th turn - Hamaya
If all goes well, it goes like this, if not I'm sorry
Law Hero - STR
Hero - VIT

Use the MAG incense on the Heroine and equip the drop from Ozawa if you were lucky to get it. Traestro.


Use the amulet instead of the Core Shield in B1F. You'll have to go around later.

Nebiros: Tarukaja, Charm, Return, Attack, Sword
Summon Cu Sith back on the first slot.

Save at Ginza and go to Shinagawa.

Devil Summoner 1: 	1st - Tamagaeri
			2nd - Tamagaeri
			3rd - ドルミナーDormina with Cu Sith, こどくざら, Dormina with 									Heroine

Change party order to Cu Sith, Kushinada Hime, Heroine, Hero

Enter Shinagawa and turn back around to the YES/NO screen and press No. This makes it so after using traestro instead of standing on top of the building you stand in front of it, avoiding that 1 tile of encounters.

Bookmark the terminal, go to Healer, heal Cu Sith and buy 2x Tamagaeri and 1x Hamaya

Devil Summoner 2:	1st - Hamaya
			2nd - Tamagaeri
			3rd - Tamagaeri

Traestro and re-enter, go to the Messia (if they kick you out, heal someone again at healer), buy like 6 charms and 2x せがきまい 

Transfer to Ginza. Go to Ikebukuro and do the skip.

In Bishamonten's lair, return Cu Sith after casting estoma.
Bishamonten: Defend, Mazio, Holy Water/せがきまい
		Both - VIET

Enter Ueno through the top, normally. Make sure you remember the way to the fight without talking to Lucifer. Summon Goblin before Ladon. 
Ladon: Both - VIT

Summon Cu Sith and get out, get Magician Mask.

Jikoukuten: Defend, Defend, Defend, Holy Water/せがきまい

Enter TDL, turn back around to the YES/NO screen and press No. Cast TRAPORT to Ginza.
Do shopping normally, watch out for money. 

Summon Goblin on top after equipping everything after getting the bullets.

Echidna: 
Tarukaja, Return (Kushinada), Mazio, Charm - THIS WORKS SOMEHOW BELIEVE ME
If Charm misses, repeat, if not:
Tarukaja, Gun, Gun
After ~4 tarukaja, return Goblin
