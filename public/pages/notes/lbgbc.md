## Moila

![World Map](/images/lbmaps/WMAP1.png) ![Town of Moila](/images/lbmaps/MOIRA.png)

## Arrow Town
---

![World Map](/images/lbmaps/WMAP1.png) ![Oasis](/images/lbmaps/OASIS.png)

Now you're ready to precede with the adventure. Skip stopping by Remlia (2) (possibly stop for safety) and head to the Oasis (4). On the way there get:

*   Sasori `タムズ` (Type 1) (Race B)
*   Kobold `コバルト`(Type 1) (Race A)
*   Kimalis `キマリス` (Type 1) (Race B)

*   Harpy `ハーピー` (Type 4) (Race E)

If you only have 3 demons, that's okay. Get the Lete Water (01) and death warp if you get an encounter. If you don't, leave, summon all your demons, heal and try to get more demons. Defeat some enemies on the way to get more experience and money.

This strat - not deathwarpping - is riskier as some of your demons might die on the way and you really don't want that. It might save time, though, as you get more money/exp and possibly more demons.

![Arrow Town](/images/lbmaps/ARROWTOWN.png) ![Doctor's House](/images/lbmaps/ARROWTDOC.png)

Then head to Mt. Palo (5). Talk to the man on the stairs, who now should let you through.

Recruit:

*   Mammoth `ハンババ` (Type 2) (Race F)

*   Spider (Type 5)
*   Baku (Type 1)
*   Blob (Type 2)
*   Laluhn (Type 3)

All of these are pretty weak and have low health.

---
## Meruha
---

![World Map](/images/lbmaps/WMAP3.png) ![Town of Meruha](/images/lbmaps/MERUHA1.png)

![General Store](/images/lbmaps/MERUHA2.png) ![Zord Cave](/images/lbmaps/ZORDCAVE1.png)

Enter Harappa (7). Enter the city only to bookmark it, then leave.

Now you need to grind Partner to level 13 so he can have enough speed to run away from Zords at the Zord Cave, the main location in which we'll do the biggest grinding section of the game. There are two strats you can do for that, a slower and a faster one:

Slow strat, grind in the trees and wait for Banshees and especially Kelpies and Mudo them. They aren't especially weak to Mudo so it can miss but after a bunch of them you level up. It has to be solo encounters of them - hoards of 2x or 3x,but there can't be any others demon species. The pros of this strat is that you still have equipment so you don't die as easily and you get more money to buy Panas.

Zord Cave Zord Gamble - Faster, riskier strat, go to Zord Cave, summon demons whose health is lower than 35 and put them in front of El and Kishe, lowest health first, and wait for a hoard of 3 Zords to show up so you can Mudo them. You can also kill 2x or 1x - the rule of thumb is you always need at least the same amount of demons in front of El and Kishe as there are enemies. Now two scenarios can happen: they only attack the demons, you survive and level up to 13 or they attack Kishe or El physically or with Bufulaon and you die. Because of the likelihood of dying you can safety save right at the entrance of the cave and reload if that happens - recommended.

As soon as you hit level 13 with Partner, release all demons. Preferable avoid dying as you will be sent back to Remlia.

Head to Meruha (8) and sell all armour (C). Buy as many Panaパナ as possible and Head to the Zord Cave (9). Grind to level 18 with Hero by using Mudo `ムド` with Partner on Zord H `ゾード`.

Point Assignments:

*   El - Points into SPD until level 14, Points into Endurance after
*   Kishe - Points into SPD until level 13, Points into Endurance after

The grind will take some time. As you level up, you will be able to recruit different demons so make sure to get them. Try to defeat as many Zords as possible and escape from other encounters to save on Mudo. Recover MP with Pana パナ whenever necessary.

When you run out of MP, go back to Meruha and heal up/buy more Pana `パナ`.

Recruit:

*   Banshee ( Type 4) - Outside
*   (NEED TO BE AT LEVEL 15) Alcheny `アルケニー` (Type 2) (Race F) - In Zord's Cave

Enter Shrine of Hypnos (10) to transfer to a different part of the map.
