Names of the demons are in english but the game is in japanese.

You get estoma pretty early on. It's implied that you should keep estoma up at all times except when grinding. 

When you're hunting for a specific demon to recruit, it can be faster to just save and soft reset until you get the encounter you want. Most of the times, it takes 3 attempts until you can successfully run away and you'll want to be conservative with Smoke Bomb usage so they last you until the last dungeons, where they are specifically important.
