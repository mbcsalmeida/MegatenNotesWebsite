DemiKids - Dark Version Speedrun Notes
========================

## General Information
Hold A and mash B to mash through text fast. You can just hold A and run into stuff instead of mashing to talk/investigate stuff. Fuse demons in order specified in the notes, selecting another demon first can create different results. You don't have to wait for Repel to run out before using it again. Buffs and debuffs stack 7 times. Gale keeps buffs even after dying and being revived. Open and closing the map keeps encounters away for a handful of steps.
