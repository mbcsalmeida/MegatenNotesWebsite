Events (A) and (B) are fixed Jaki Orc encounters in which Chaos Hero uses Agiアギ and the others defend.

### Underground Mall

After leaving the Lab, head to the Underground Mall. The exp from just fixed fights is not enough to level Chaos Hero to 13 by the time recruits could be over, so fighting an encounter is required: Haunt Oshichi dies to Zanザン, Night Imp and Jaki Orc die to Agiアギ.

![ ](images/smt1maps/2D/04-Shinjuku-Mall.png) ![ ](images/smt1maps/3D/SHINJUKU-B1F.png)

This is where most recruits can be done with the exception of Fairy Dryad, but it's also not the last place these demons can be found. Make sure to talk away encounters with demons already recruited as they may give money, magnetite, and Life Stonesませき that can be used for negotiations.
