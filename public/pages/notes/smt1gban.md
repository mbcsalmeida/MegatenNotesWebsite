![Lab 2F](/images/smt1maps/3D/LABORATORY-2F.png) 

![Lab 1F](/images/smt1maps/3D/LABORATORY-1F.png)

Events (A) and (B) are fixed Jaki Orc encounters in which Chaos Hero uses Agi `アギ` and the others defend.

### Underground Mall

After leaving the Lab, head to the Underground Mall. The exp from just fixed fights is not enough to level Chaos Hero to 13 by the time recruits could be over, so fighting an encounter is required: Haunt Oshichi dies to Zan ``ザン``, Night Imp and Jaki Orc die to Agi ``アギ``.

![Shinjuku](/images/smt1maps/2D/GBA-04-Shinjuku-Mall.png) 

![Shinjuku Underground Mall B1F](/images/smt1maps/3D/SHINJUKU-B1F.png)

This is where most recruits can be done with the exception of Fairy Dryad, but it's also not the last place these demons can be found. Make sure to talk away encounters with demons already recruited as they may give money, magnetite, and Life Stones ``ませき`` that can be used for negotiations.

Head to the southernmost bar and talk to the barman: talk to him → yes → no → yes. Head downstairs on the northeastern set of stairs.

![Shinjuku Underground Mall B1F](/images/smt1maps/3D/SHINJUKU-B1F-2.png)
