Thank you to **[masaya](https://www.nicovideo.jp/user/22877929)** for his incessant ground-breaking work in SMT1 speedrunning, having found many glitches that became Any% routes and optimizations for the NMG routes as well. 

Thank you, as well, to **[mizusima40](https://mizusima40.seesaa.net/)**, the current WR holder for many Megaten records, for making his notes available to the public and continuously working hard at achieving good times.

Thank you to [Symm\_](https://www.twitch.tv/symm_), one of the first english-speaking runners to run most of the classic megaten games; [lradial](https://www.twitch.tv/lradial), one of the people who most cheered me on and gave me motivation to continue speedrunning; [filthyblasphemer](https://www.twitch.tv/filthyblasphemer), my SMT1 race partner, whom I share one of my most fun gaming memories with.
