This website is a collection of speedrun notes of games I've run, interesting information about said games and a list of my personal bests. Every router and person involved with each game are mentioned in the Credits page.

### "Isn't this the same as what's available on speedrun.com?"

Short answer: yes.

Long answer: I created this website in order to learn the webdev trifecta (HTML+CSS+Javascript). Between waiting to do a boring project for some class I decided to take that dealt with this and making something myself that interested me and that I'd personally find purposeful, I decided to make this. Did I succeed? Somewhat.

Now, most of the notes available here are too available on each respective game's speedrun.com page. However, I felt like I had more creative freedom making them available on a website and some future notes may only be made available here.

Profile

I'm Sion and I'm a portuguese speedrunner who mostly focus on JRPGs, specifically megaten games. I most enjoy running games and categories that haven't been run before and making them more easily runnable by making overly detailed notes and resources for them, and then peer-pressuring every speedrunner I know into running them.

My speedrun plans are to run every classic SFC megaten game, followed by every GB/GBC megaten game, before moving on to PSX/GBA megaten - and, maybe, only then, move on to modern megaten. Plans might, and will, change.
