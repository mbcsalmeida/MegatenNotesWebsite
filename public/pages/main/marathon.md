# Marathon Runs
---

### SMT Marathon II

**Thoughts:** The very first marathon run I did running a MegaTen game. I was very nervous as to go wrong and hoo boy did things go wrong. From dying to the last boss fight to glitches that deleted savefiles, everything happened in this race. It's still a very precious memory and a run I like to revisit from time to time.

### Really Really Long-a-thon 2

**Thoughts:** One of my famous bad ideas to submit both SMT1 All Bosses and SMT2 Glitchless Law and then be slotted to run both back to back. Despite how strainuous it was, it was very fun and all my fear of dropping manip thankfully didn't happen. I did however die to the last boss fight, how does this keep happening in marathon runs.

### Questing for Glory 4

**Thoughts:** The one upside to this run was that it was only 40 minutes long, being a glitched category. I don't particularly like this category and submitted it only as peer-pressure from Symm. That being said, the run was very fun and I'm glad to have done it. Hilariously, a week later, masaya created the new Any% route that would bring the time down 12 minutes.

### Shin Megami Tensei Trifecta

**Thoughts:** Not exactly an external marathon but a little challenge/follower celebration that could count as a personal marathon of sorts. Doing all the games back to back proved to be a lot of fun and ended up sparking my desire to get new PBs in SMT2 Law and SMT If... Yumi. SMT1, however, went terribly because my muscle memory was stuck on the old route used in GBA. The entire thing was very fun and I'm looking forward to doing another one of these challenges again.

### SNES Super Stars 2022

**Thoughts:** Incredible run in general. Very fun and I was very focused and felt like everything go well. Just a good ol' time with my buddies FilthyBlasphemer and SymmRTA on commentary.

### ESA Summer 2022

**Thoughts:** It had been a dream of mine from the very first time I saw a marathon run to one day do a run myself in an event. To do so and run a megaten game, a JRPG and a not so popular one, was even better. Even though the circumstances weren’t the best and my preparation was very rushed, I am very happy with this run. Getting to have my friends there with me made it all the better. A memory I’ll treasure forever.
