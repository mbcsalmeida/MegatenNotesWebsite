### Shin Megami Tensei

**Category:** Any%

**Rules:** Timing starts on START and end on the last period of the credits.

**Thoughts:** Run that I did right after this route got built. Not a big Any% guy, but this route is overall a great improvement over the last run. I've had a lot of run teaching this run to other people though, so I appreciate its existence. However, when it comes to me myself running the game, I don't have many plans.

**Category:** No Major Glitches - Law

**Rules:** Timing starts on powering on the console and end on the last period of the credits.Shop glitch, Heroine glitch, Manipulation aren't allowed.

**Thoughts:** This PB was fruit of a long stream where I was committed to getting a PB and a PB I got, despite not being an incredible one. The recruitment section was nothing out of ordinary and battles weren't particularly fast. Definitely room for improvement where there a similar run with better recruitments.
					
**Category:** No Major Glitches - Neutral

**Rules:** Timing starts on powering on the console and end on the last period of the credits.Shop glitch, Heroine glitch, Manipulation aren't allowed.

**Thoughts:** I didn't grind this category down much and Michael was a bad fight. Might go for a sub 2 one day, if I'm feeling the self-hatred.

**Category:** No Major Glitches - Chaos

**Rules:** Timing starts on powering on the console and end on the last period of the credits. Shop glitch, Heroine glitch, Manipulation aren't allowed.

**Thoughts:** A good run. My one regret was getting lost in the cathedral which lost me a considerable amount of time. Despite that, it's still a time I'm proud of.

**Category:** All Bosses

**Rules:** Timing starts on powering on the console and end on the last period of the credits. Shop glitch, Heroine glitch, Manipulation aren't allowed.

**Thoughts:** The charm route turned this run into a very interesting one. The route is very dynamic and there being a lot of fights is quite interesting, bringing the possible timesave, and run killers, up a lot. It's quite possibly the best category for SMT1. That being said, the Blue Phantom + Red Phantom section makes this beyond a pain to grind. There'd need to be some detailed routing for that section in order to reduce the frequency in which we die to them.

### Megami Tensei Gaiden: Last Bible

**Category:** Any% (GB)

**Rules:** Timing starts on START and end on the last frame of the credits.

**Thoughts:** A one and done. Since I've run this, I've learnt a lot about this game so I could certainly bring the time down. However, this version is slower, in a more boring way, than GBC so I doubt I'll run it again.

**Category:** Any% (GBC)

**Rules:** Timing starts on START and end on the last frame of the credits.

**Thoughts:** I grinded this. I'm proud of this time even though I know I can do better. I know exactly where my timesaves are and maybe one day I'll grind it again. However, and this is a big however, the very last boss fight is a huge run killer that makes grinding this incredibly painful.

### Megami Tensei Gaiden: Last Bible II

**Category:** Any% (GBC)

**Rules:** Timing starts on START and end on the last frame of the credits. MP cheat is allowed.

**Thoughts:** Another one I didn't invest too much time into yet due to some annoyances with some grinding sections. The music is excellent and somewhat makes up for it, and I'm glad I ran it for the sake of running all Last Bible games, but I'm not too interested in grinding it.

### Another Bible

**Rules:** Timing starts on START and end on the last frame of the credits.

**Thoughts:** Yikes.

### Shin Megami Tensei II (SFC)

**Category:** Glitchless - Law

**Rules:** Timing starts on powering on the console and ends on the last frame of the credits. Elevator glitch is allowed.

**Thoughts:** A good run with the only big timeloss being a bad Lucifer fight. Having 1 hour of manip makes this very tiring to grind however but I'm likely to come back to ti.

**Category:** Glitchless - Chaos

**Rules:** Timing starts on powering on the console and ends on the last frame of the credits. Elevator glitch is allowed.

**Thoughts:** Good run. There have been some new optimizations brought forth from the neutral routing that could be applied here to make it safer and faster so maybe I'll run it again.

**Category:** All Bosses

**Rules:** Timing starts on powering on the console and ends on the last frame of the credits. Elevator glitch is allowed.

**Thoughts:** A very unfortunate death that set me back over 10 minutes turned this into a worst run than it can possibly be. Maybe when I forget the pain of dying to Atavaka I'll run it again.

### Shin Megami Tensei If... (SFC)

**Category:** Yumi Route

**Rules:** Done on SFC version, English patch is allowed. Timing starts on Power ON. Timing ends when THE END fully appears. Yumi Shirakawa must be the partner.

**Thoughts:** It's a fun run, a fun manip to execute and its biggest setback is sloth. Yet I'm having a hard time being too interested in running it, unfortunately. I'll try to go for a good time on and off.

### Shin Megami Tensei I... (GBA)

**Category:** Glitchless - Law

**Rules:** Start the timer on START selection and stop the timer when "End." fully appears on screen. Restricted on not using any bugs/glitches.

**Thoughts:** It's the good ol' old route for SMT1 with the added running speed, fast text and straffing. In some places, the speed actually feels too fast for the size of the maps. What kills this run for me is the Arachne fight and the inconsistent Sylph fusion. Can't see myself grinding this further down.

**Category:** Glitchless - Chaos

**Rules:** Start the timer on START selection and stop the timer when "End." fully appears on screen. Restricted on not using any bugs/glitches.

**Thoughts:** Compared to Law this is admittedly worse, despite not having Echidna. The cathedral requires buying Smoke Bombs to repel demons as estoma doesn't work due to the level difference and, being Chaos, we have to tranverse lower cathedral twice, meaning double the Smoke Bombs needed in other categories. I'm glad I did it but it was not enjoyable.

**Category:** Corrupted Save

**Rules:** Start the timer on START selection and stop the timer when "End." fully appears on screen. Any bug/glitch is allowed.

**Thoughts:** A bit of a meme run to be honest. Only did it because Symm didn't know you could run in the GBA version and I wanted to know how must faster traversing the cathedral while running would be. Despite some mistakes, it proved to be around 40 seconds faster.

### Devil Children: Puzzle de Call!

**Rules:** Clear the game once to skip cutscenes. Beat the game with one character as fast as possible. Time starts on Character Select. Time ends when you stand on the last red damage circle for the final boss. (Open to change this). No Turbo. New Game on a fresh file. Play as Rand

**Category:** Rand Route

**Thoughts:** This is what happens when you joke around about running a game and then your friend does it and peer-pressures you into doing it too. Running puzzle games is hilarious as always. The game is fun though, and so is the speedrun to a certain degree. The boss RNG is pretty frustrating though.

**Category:** Gale Route

**Thoughts:** This is what happens when you joke around about routing the other seperate category of a meme game and then do it for your friend who originally peer-pressured you into running the game and then the friend never does it. Maps are so much longer than Rand, it makes it for a considerably worse speedrun experience. Casually it was very enjoyable.

### Devil Children: Red Book and Black Book (PSX)

**Rules:** Time begins on Start and end at the start of the credits.

**Category:** Red Book

**Thoughts:** I quite enjoyed this run but didn't feel like grinding it at the time so I stopped. If some more competition comes along, I might try for WR.

**Category:** Black Book

**Thoughts:** Slightly grindier than Red Book due to the order in which we traverse the dungeons. The bosses are also a little harder so the worst of the two speedrun-wise. Probably won't touch it any time soon, if I was gonna grind one of the two it'd be Red Book.

### Devil Summoner (PSP)

**Rules:** Time starts on choosing difficulty and ends on the last textbox.

**Category:** Any%

**Thoughts:** So. I love this game, I quite like the run. RNG mess of the worst kind. The usage of the one-way door glitch makes traversing the game a thousand times more enjoyable. But. And this is a big but. The fact that you can't escape encounters and need to talk to every single one of them in order to run away makes this the worst of the worst. If there was any way to get smoke bombs and spam them, this would be \*THE\* run. The best of the best. But as it stands, it's beyond painful. I can take reflect-strats BS, not demon negotiation BS. Alas.

### DemiKids: Light Version and Dark Version

**Rules:** Time starts on start and ends on the start of the credits.

**Category:** Any%

**Thoughts:** One of my favourite Devil Children runs for sure. A little grindy at the end and having to recruit demons can get a bit annoying but overall really fun. Except for the last boss fight. Peak levels of stress there.

### Shin Megami Tensei V

**Rules:** Timing starts on difficulty selection and ends on last hit on the final boss. Any ending can be obtained.

**Category:** Normal - Any%

**Thoughts:** Man. This run had so much potential to be great. The fact that you can just avoid the demons and run through the areas and dungeons. Estoma working on all the demons. So much potential. All down the drain by the damage calculations. Having to hunt for mitamas and grind so we can actually face the boss fights is such a drag. And the boss fights being so spongy also sucks. Just - bad. Maybe I'll run it again some other day but I just. Don't like it.

**Category:** Safety - Any%

**Thoughts:** THIS IS THE ONE. It's kinda overly simple but I really love the route we made up that just reduces all the requirements to a bare minimum and lets us sweep the floor with all the fights. It can get a bit boring because we're basically just running all the time but it's still the most enjoyable SMTV category by far.

**Category:** Safety - TNE

**Thoughts:** It's Any% but longer and slightly more boring. Thought fighting Shiva is kinda cool, but it dies so fast that it's not worth it.

### Last Bible III

**Rules:** Time starts on turning on Power On and ends on "end." fully showing up after the credits.

**Category:** Any%

**Thoughts:** So. This run is very dumb. It basically abuses the debug mode they left included in the game to get some broken bug demons and deal copious amounts of damage. The demon can be annoying to get and we need to get it multiple times. Then we just cruise through the game. It's boring, it's weird but it's done.

### Persona 4 Golden

**Rules:** Get any ending on any difficulty, the PC version can modify the difficulty during the run. Timing starts when selecting a difficulty on and ends on NG+ save.

**Category:** Any% - PC

**Thoughts:** What can I say, done at ESA Summer 2022 with my friend scolding me over my shoulder the entire time because I kept messing up and not reading the notes. But in my defense! I've never played P4G, I've never played P4 at all so I literally had no idea what was going on. Still, I had a great time and it's great to know I won't have to run this game again cuz it's been done in one way now : D

### Shin Megami Tensei Trading Card: Card Summoner

**Rules:** Timing begins on selecting New Game. Timing ends when credits stop rolling. Use of any 2 Player features via a GameBoy Link Cable is banned.

**Category:** Any%

**Thoughts:** I have so many feelings about this game.

### Devil Children: Fire Book and Ice Book

**Rules:** Timing starts on Begin (はじめから) and ends on the start of the credits.

**Category:** Fire Book

**Thoughts:** Another devil children run, they all feel pretty similar. Game is a bit boring and the encounter rate is through the roof at the end, which is the part that I dislike the most. Other than that, it's a pretty fun run. Can go sub 3 very easily with some route adjustments and better luck.
