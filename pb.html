			<p><b>Thoughts:</b> The charm route turned this run into a very interesting one. The route is very dynamic
				and there being a lot of fights is quite interesting, bringing the possible timesave, and run killers,
				up a lot. It's quite possibly the best category for SMT1. That being said, the Blue Phantom + Red
				Phantom section makes this beyond a pain to grind. There'd need to be some detailed routing for that
				section in order to reduce the frequency in which we die to them.</p>

			<p><b>Thoughts:</b> It's the good ol' old route for SMT1 with the added running speed, fast text and

				run for me is the Arachne fight and the inconsistent Sylph fusion. Can't see myself grinding this
				further down.</p>

			<p><b>Thoughts:</b> Compared to Law this is admittedly worse, despite not having Echidna. The cathedral
				requires buying Smoke Bombs to repel demons as estoma doesn't work due to the level difference and,
				being Chaos, we have to tranverse lower cathedral twice, meaning double the Smoke Bombs needed in other
				categories. I'm glad I did it but it was not enjoyable.</p>

			<p><b>Thoughts:</b> This is what happens when you joke around about running a game and then your friend does

				fun though, and so is the speedrun to a certain degree. The boss RNG is pretty frustrating though.</p>

			<p><b>Thoughts:</b> This is what happens when you joke around about routing the other seperate category of a

				then the friend never does it. Maps are so much longer than Rand, it makes it for a considerably worse

			<p><b>Category:</b> Black Book </p>
			<p><b>Thoughts:</b> Slightly grindier than Red Book due to the order in which we traverse the dungeons. The

			<p><b>Category:</b> Any% </p>
			<p><b>Thoughts:</b> So. I love this game, I quite like the run. RNG mess of the worst kind. The usage of the
				one-way door glitch makes traversing the game a thousand times more enjoyable. But. And this is a
				big but. The fact that you can't escape encounters and need to talk to every single one of them in
				order to run away makes this the worst of the worst. If there was any way to get smoke bombs and
				spam them, this would be *THE* run. The best of the best. But as it stands, it's beyond painful. I
				can take reflect-strats BS, not demon negotiation BS. Alas.</b>

			<p><b>Category:</b> Normal - Any% </p>
			<p><b>Thoughts:</b> Man. This run had so much potential to be great. The fact that you can just avoid the
				demons and run through the areas and dungeons. Estoma working on all the demons. So much potential. All
				down the drain by the damage calculations. Having to hunt for mitamas and grind so we can actually face
				the boss fights is such a drag. And the boss fights being so spongy also sucks. Just - bad. Maybe I'll
				run it again some other day but I just. Don't like it.</p>

			<p><b>Thoughts:</b> THIS IS THE ONE. It's kinda overly simple but I really love the route we made up that

			<p><b>Category:</b> Any% </p>
			<p><b>Thoughts:</b> So. This run is very dumb. It basically abuses the debug mode they left included in the
