<p><b>Category:</b> Any%
<p><b>Rules:</b> Timing starts on START and end on the last period of the credits.</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> A derust run that I did to prepare for a marathon which includes a death, which is pretty ridiculous. Unfortunately, I'm
not too fond of this run so I'll only go for a PB again if the planets align themselves or something.</p>

<p><b>Category:</b> No Major Glitches - Law
<p><b>Rules:</b> Timing starts on powering on the console and end on the last period of the credits.Shop glitch, Heroine glitch, Manipulation aren't allowed.</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> This PB was fruit of a long stream where I was committed to getting a PB and a PB I got, despite not being an incredible one. The recruitment section was nothing out of ordinary and battles weren't particularly fast. Definitely room for improvement where there a similar run with better recruitments.</p>

<p><b>Thoughts:</b> I didn't grind this category down much and Michael was a bad fight. Might go for a sub 2 one day, if I'm feeling the self-hatred.</p>

<p><b>Rules:</b> Timing starts on powering on the console and end on the last period of the credits. Shop glitch, Heroine glitch, Manipulation aren't allowed.</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> A good run. My one regret was getting lost in the cathedral which lost me a considerable amount of time. Despite that, it's still a time I'm proud of.</p>

<p><b>Rules:</b> Timing starts on powering on the console and end on the last period of the credits. Shop glitch, Heroine glitch, Manipulation aren't allowed.</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> The charm route turned this run into a very interesting one. The route is very dynamic and there being a lot of fights is quite interesting, bringing the possible timesave, and run killers, up a lot. It's quite possibly the best category for SMT1. That being said, the Blue Phantom + Red Phantom section makes this beyond a pain to grind. There'd need to be some detailed routing for that section in order to reduce the frequency in which we die to them.</p>

<h3 style="line-height: 2; border: 10px double #000;">Megami Tensei Gaiden: Last Bible</h3>
<p><b>Category:</b> Any% (GB)
<p><b>Rules:</b> Timing starts on START and end on the last frame of the credits.</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> A one and done. Since I've run this, I've learnt a lot about this game so I could certainly bring the time down. However, this version is slower, in a more boring way, than GBC so I doubt I'll run it again.</p>

<p><b>Category:</b> Any% (GBC)
<p><b>Rules:</b> Timing starts on START and end on the last frame of the credits.</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> I grinded this. I'm proud of this time even though I know I can do better. I know exactly where my timesaves are and maybe one day I'll grind it again. However, and this is a big however, the very last boss fight is a huge run killer that makes grinding this incredibly painful.</p>

<p><b>Category:</b> Any% (GBC)
<p><b>Rules:</b> Timing starts on START and end on the last frame of the credits. MP cheat is allowed.</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> Another one I didn't invest too much time into yet due to some annoyances with some grinding sections. The music is excellent and somewhat makes up for it, and I'm glad I ran it for the sake of running all Last Bible games, but I'm not too interested in grinding it.</p>

<p><b>Category:</b> Glitchless - Law
<p><b>Rules:</b> Timing starts on powering on the console and ends on the last frame of the credits. Elevator glitch is allowed.</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> A good run with the only big timeloss being a bad Lucifer fight. Having 1 hour of manip makes this very tiring to grind however but I'm likely to come back to ti.</p>

<p><b>Thoughts:</b> Good run. There have been some new optimizations brought forth from the neutral routing that could be applied here to make it safer and faster so maybe I'll run it again.</p>

<p><b>Rules:</b> Timing starts on powering on the console and ends on the last frame of the credits. Elevator glitch is allowed.</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> A very unfortunate death that set me back over 10 minutes turned this into a worst run than it can possibly be. Maybe when I forget the pain of dying to Atavaka I'll run it again.</p>

<p><b>Category:</b> Yumi Route</p>
<p><b>Rules:</b> Done on SFC version, English patch is allowed.

Timing starts on Power ON.

Timing ends when THE END fully appears. Yumi Shirakawa must be the partner.</p> 
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> It's a fun run, a fun manip to execute and its biggest setback is sloth. Yet I'm having a hard time being too interested in running it, unfortunately. I'll try to go for a good time on and off.</p>

<h3 style="line-height: 2; border: 10px double #000;">Shin Megami Tensei I... (GBA)</h3>
<p><b>Category:</b> Glitchless - Law </p>
<p><b>Rules:</b> Start the timer on START selection and stop the timer when "End." fully appears on screen. Restricted on not using any bugs/glitches.</p> 
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> It's the good ol' old route for SMT1  with the added running speed, fast text and straffing. In some places, the speed actually feels too fast for the size of the maps. What kills this run for me is the Arachne fight and the inconsistent Sylph fusion. Can't see myself grinding this further down.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Category:</b> Glitchless - Chaos </p>
<p><b>Rules:</b> Start the timer on START selection and stop the timer when "End." fully appears on screen. Restricted on not using any bugs/glitches.</p> 
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> Compared to Law this is admittedly worse, despite not having Echidna. The cathedral requires buying Smoke Bombs to repel demons as estoma doesn't work due to the level difference and, being Chaos, we have to tranverse lower cathedral twice, meaning double the Smoke Bombs needed in other categories. I'm glad I did it but it was not enjoyable.</p>

<p><b>Category:</b> Corrupted Save </p>
<p><b>Rules:</b> Start the timer on START selection and stop the timer when "End." fully appears on screen. Any bug/glitch is allowed.</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> A bit of a meme run to be honest. Only did it because Symm didn't know you could run in the GBA version and I wanted to know how must faster traversing the cathedral while running would be. Despite some mistakes, it proved to be around 40 seconds faster.</p>

<h3 style="line-height: 2; border: 10px double #000;">Devil Children: Puzzle de Call!</h3>
<p><b>Category:</b> Rand Route </p>
<p><b>Rules:</b> Clear the game once to skip cutscenes.
Beat the game with one character as fast as possible.
Time starts on Character Select.
Time ends when you stand on the last red damage circle for the final boss. (Open to change this).
No Turbo.
New Game on a fresh file. Play as Rand</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> This is what happens when you joke around about running a game and then your friend does it and peer-pressures you into doing it too. Running puzzle games is hilarious as always. The game is fun though, and so is the speedrun to a certain degree. The boss RNG is pretty frustrating though.</p>

<p><b>Rules:</b> Clear the game once to skip cutscenes.
Beat the game with one character as fast as possible.
Time starts on Character Select.
Time ends when you stand on the last red damage circle for the final boss. (Open to change this).
No Turbo.
New Game on a fresh file. Play as Gale</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> This is what happens when you joke around about routing the other seperate category of a meme game and then do it for your friend who originally peer-pressured you into running the game and then the friend never does it. Maps are so much longer than Rand, it makes it for a considerably worse speedrun experience. Casually it was very enjoyable.</p>
