<h2>About</h2>
<p>Turbo is allowed and overall recommendations are just having Start on auto for dialogue skipping and when saving at
terminals. Naming characters with Start on auto is not a good idea, so as soon as a new game starts it’s preferable to disable
it and enable it back after naming the Heroine. Auto Start also makes the fusion result show for a short period so it may take
a bit of practice to identify Sylph quickly.</p>
<p>In dungeons mashing forward is faster than just holding the D-pad forward, with each area having a different scrolling
speed.</p>
<p>When leveling up a stat for more than a single level it’s faster to alternate D-pad right and A than to just press A.</p>
<p>After a certain point in the run encounters aren’t a problem anymore due to Estoma . That said, there are many
encounters that can kill you and your demons if you don’t use Estoma properly: after entering and leaving most buildings,
after every Traport and Traesto cast, and after every terminal transfer.</p>
<p>Timer starts at console on, mash Start to start a new game.</p>
<p>Demons to recruit:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="tooltip">Fairy Goblin<span class="tooltiptext">ヨウセイ ゴブリン</span></span> - Lv 6
<li><span class="tooltip">Fairy Pyro Jack<span class="tooltiptext">ヨウセイ ジャックランタン</span></span> - Lv 9
<li><span class="tooltip">Fairy Dryad<span class="tooltiptext">ヨウセイ ドリアード</span></span> - Lv 12
<li><span class="tooltip">Night Imp<span class="tooltiptext">ヤマ インプ</span></span> - Lv 7
<li><span class="tooltip">Beast Cu Sith<span class="tooltiptext">ジュウ カーシー</span></span> - Lv 12
<li><span class="tooltip">Brute Azumi<span class="tooltiptext">ヨウキ アズミ</span></span> - Lv10
</ul>
<p>Money is of no concern in this segment and Life Stones can be used freely in negotiations if you have any.</p>
<p>Agreeing to give an item that you don’t currently have will most likely make the demon leave or attack you.</p>

<h2>Glitches</h2>

<h3>Shop Item Glitch</h3>
<p>Buy - Execution: Go into any shop and select “Buy” with A and keep the button held until the inventory is displayed. Then back with B without letting go of A. A dialogue box will pop up asking if you’re sure you want to buy “X” item. Say “Yes” if you do. This item will be one that is not included in the purchasable items of the store and will differ from store to store. In the route, they’re referred to as “Hidden items”.</p>
<p>Sell - Execution: Go into any shop that will allow you to sell items, select "Sell" with A and keep the button held until the inventory is displayed. Then back with B without letting go of A. A dialogue box will pop up asking if you would like to sell your Attack Knife. Select "Yes", and you'll be paid for the Attack Knife, regardless of whether or not you had one in your inventory.</p>
<h3>Heroine Clone</h3>
<p>Exclusive to version 1.1/revision A of SMT, if by the time you reunite with the Heroine at the bar in Shinjuku’s underground mall, in the event where Law Hero and Chaos Hero leave your party, you have a full inventory, the Heroine will join you for a brief moment and then leave again, saying you need to clear space in the inventory to receive the Fake ID Card that lets you go into the American Embassy. After clearing space, you can turn back and she’ll join you. However, if you turn back once more, the Heroine will still be there and the same event will happen - you’ll end up with a clone of the Heroine.</p>
<p>This clone will share the same stats of the original and any damage dealt on the Heroine will be dealt as well on the clones. Similarly, if you revive or recover HP/MP on any of the Heroines, all the clones will recover as well. </p>
<p>The glitch occurs when you get more than one clone of the Heroine and level them up. They level up easy because they get as many times the exp per battle as there are Heroine clones, so if you defeat a Goblin that gives 35xp, you’ll get 35*5xp on the Heroine. If after levelling up the Heroine, you get one other extra clone, which would have the original entry-point Heroine stats, the Heroine stats underflow and the memory gets corrupted. This allows you to get transported to places in the map you’re not supposed to access.</p>
<p>By opening the equipment screen of the heroine with glitched stats, the names, items, yen, magnetite, direction and environment change. Depending on the location from where you opened the stats screen, you’ll get transported into different environments and clip through walls and access areas like your home after the apocalypse and the Cathedral. By abusing the menu stats in specific locations, we are able to clip into the room that spawns after beating Asura in the Law End and get the Law End credits. </p>
<p>The first room where you’re transported to in a trapzone environment where, depending on your stats, you might get hurt by the traps. How much you level up the Heroine before the underflow influences your total HP/MP (the higher the level, the lower the HP/MP and the higher the stats). If your HP is too low, you’ll get hurt by the trapzones and won’t be able to reach the final room. If the Heroine dies at any point but you still make it to the final room, you’ll get softlocked instead of getting the credits. You might also die on the way to the final room, as the Hero gets damaged as well.</p>
<p>If you get more than 6 party members, you get transported into a similar environment where you can’t move and there’s trapzones everywhere. If you repeatedly menu flash, you might run into blind maps or get Event errors, where the map registers you’re in an environment where an event should start but the memory is too corrupted to start it.</p>
<h3>Annihilation Glitch</h3>
<p>Under certain conditions, for example, after getting one-shot while having a Nyorai Statue or Rosary active, every party member can be in DEAD state without leading to a Game Over. This causes the equip menu to glitch out and memory to open up.</p>


<h2>Negotiation tips</h2>


<p>This is based entirely on my experience and doesn’t work 100% of the time, since demon negotiation is RNG based.</p>

<p>If you successfully negotiate, the demons will ask you what you want of them, and the option of “Making them your minion” will show up. If you fail, they might leave, assault you or turn violent. When they turn violent, you have to go through a turn of defending to try talking to them again.</p>

<p>Conversation options are constant in different demons - a new encounter will mostly wield the same results as before. However, some demons can change their response to the same dialogue option - this can happen with the same demon, even, so it can be worth it to try the same option more than once if you’re sure the other option will turn them violent.</p>

<p>Going friendly is usually more efficient than threatening. Threatening has a higher chance of demons escaping.</p>

<p>"Lower your weapon" will almost always turn them violent but there's a chance they'll instantly join you after. In certain recruitments, like Cait Sith, to avoid having them run away at all costs, it's the most recommended option.</p>

<p>Some recruitment sequences that usually weild good results for each demon:</p>

<h4>Pyro Jack/Goblin</h4>

<dl>
<dt><span class="tooltip">Laugh back<span class="tooltiptext">わらいかえす</span></span> -> <span class="tooltip">Calm down<span class="tooltiptext">なだめる</span></span></dt>
<dd>Will usually lead to the "Ask them to join" option</dd>
<dt>"Humans are hopeless, right?"(Yes/No option) -> Yes</dt>
<dt>(Long text in japanese, but it's a Yes/No option) -> Yes</dt>
<dd>Might have them join instantly. If not, you can still talk to them right after, without going through a turn of defending.</dd>
<dt><span class="tooltip">Lower your weapon<span class="tooltiptext">ぶきをおさめる</span></span> -> <span class="tooltip">Get close<span class="tooltiptext">ちかづく</span></span></dt>
<dd>Might have them join instantly. NOT recommended when you talking to more than one Pyro Jack and most of the time they'll turn violent and they have Agilao.</dd>
<dt><span class="tooltip">Smile<span class="tooltiptext">ほほえむ</span></span> -> <span class="tooltip">Sing<span class="tooltiptext">うたう</span></span></dt>
<dd>Usually will lead to the "Ask to join" option. Sometimes the demons don't like your singing and will instantly leave.</dd>
<dt><span class="tooltip">Smile<span class="tooltiptext">ほほえむ</span></span> -> <span class="tooltip">Persuade<span class="tooltiptext">せっとくする</span></span></dt>
<dd>Can lead to the "Ask to join" option like the one above. The demons won't leave to a failed persuasion but persuading works less often than singing. If it fails, you can talk to them again without a turn of defending.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Imp</h4>
<ul>
<li>Same options as Pyro Jack and Goblin. DON'T choose options that will turn them violent as they have Zanma and are not afraid to use it.
</ul>

<h4>Dryad</h4>
<p>Can run away easily but are mostly harmless so the best technique to recruit them is:</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="tooltip">Smile<span class="tooltiptext">ほほえむ</span></span> -> <span class="tooltip">Get close<span class="tooltiptext">ちかづく</span></span></dt>
<dd>This will usually make them attack you for one turn or cast spells like HAPPY. However, they won't run away and will hardly kill you. If you do see yourself getting low health then heal with Law Hero. You should always go for this option if it shows up until the best option to recruit them shows up. There's also a small chance they'll instantly join you with this one.</dd>
<dt><span class="tooltip">Say your name<span class="tooltiptext">なのる</span></span></dt>
<dd>Whichever two options that show up with "Say your name", always go for this one. This is the best option and it'll always move the recruitment along to the "Ask to join" option.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Azumi</h4>
<p>Just like Imp, if you encounter to many of them it can be a bit dangerous, so it's recommended you hack some of them away with Heroine's sword. Heroine will usually kill two per turn so if the encounter is two Azumi, don't attack them.</p>
<p>They usually have the same options as Imp. If you only encounter 1 or 2 then it's recommende you go for the riskier strats like ぶきをおさめる -> ちかづく as they can't kill you as easily and will more often join instantly.</p>

<h4>Cait Sith</h4>
<p>These take a long time to spawn. Do everything to make them not run away.</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="tooltip">Laugh back<span class="tooltiptext">わらいかえす</span></span> -> <span class="tooltip">Calm down<span class="tooltiptext">なだめる</span></span></dt>
<dd>In general, choose any option that has Calm Down as it won't send them away.</dd>
<dt><span class="tooltip">Lower your weapon<span class="tooltiptext">ぶきをおさめる</span></span> -> <span class="tooltip">Get close<span class="tooltiptext">ちかづく</span></span></dt>
<dd>Just like the others, chance of them instantly joining and it won't send them away.</dd>
</dl>

<p>During actual negotiations avoid giving away items (say NO) because you most likely won’t have them. Always calm down the demons in risk of them leaving if you give up. If you do get a Life Stone though, and a demon demands it, give it away. That will almost always recruit the demon and it’s not a good enough item worth keeping. Give money away freely.</p>
