<h2>About</h2>
<p>Time starts on console Power On and ends on the last frame of the credits.</p>
<p>Demon recruiting works the same as SMT2 except the option to lower your weapon will now unequip your weapon inside the battle, so beware.</p>
<p>Manip</p>
<p>If... was made using the same game engine as SMT2 so many of the features of that game transfer to this one, of relevance being the easy possibility to manip the game given you always hit the same specific frame at the Load Save File screen.</p>
<p>However, diferently from SMT2, If... doesn't have an overworld so the circumstances in which RNG is consumed are different in that regard. In both games, certain animations, and most specifically for how long they play on screen, will consume RNG. In SMT2 this is only relevant for the fusion animation, which is set to always end at the same frame, as it isn't skippable, and the transfering animation, which is very easy to always skip at the first frame by holding down a turbo button or simply mashing A. However in If..., the hub to transfer between worlds, the Seal room, which is the closest the game has to an overworld, has a new animation that will consume RNG, the void that grows bigger as you recover the rings in each domain, which is particularly hard to always skip at the same frame and gets harder as it grows. This is one of the main reasons why the manip ends after World of Gluttony, the other being that the game is pretty consistent and not to dangerous after World of Sloth. To help complete more runs, the If... manip actually has 2 frame window for World of Pride and 3 frame window for World of Gluttony that was manipped and you can hit and still be on manip. They're referred below as Seal RNG Options. </p>
<p>Other than that, the manip is not hard to execute excpet for hitting the initial frame. </p>
