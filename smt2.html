<h1 style="margin: 0;padding: 0;line-height: 3;border: 10px double #000;text-shadow: 0px 0px 5px #ffffff;">Shin Megami Tensei II</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>Time starts on console Power On and ends on the last frame of the credits.</p>
<p>Elevator cancel glitch is allowed. Event reproduction glitch is allowed.</p>
<p>Turbo is allowed. The fastest way of mashing is holding a D-Pad button while mashing A or B. Holding X makes the menu
scroll faster, thought it can make it a bit too fast to control properly.</p>
<h2>Glitches</h2>
<h3>Elevator Cancel</h3>
<p>When you enter an elevator, in the screen to choose which level to go to, move the cursor to it but press B instead of A. Where normally you'd just back out of the elevator screen, due to the wondrous existence of elevator cancel glitch, exclusive to the first two releases of Shin Megami Tensei II for the Super Famicom, you'll skip the animation of the elevator and simply leave to the level you had the cursor on. In a speedrun context, it saves some time. Casually, it can happen accidentally very often, but it's not a dangerous glitch at all.</p>
<h3>Event Reproduction</h3>
<p>A glitch that happens in event tiles, that is, tiles in which some kind of cutscene or set dialogue is meant to pop up, if you turn around in the same tile after the event is over but don't move from it. It's not harmful but it can be used to go out of bounds conjoint with the traesto warp glitch.</p>
<h2>Manip</h2>
<p>These notes are pretty rough around the edges but guide the general actions to perform the manip. The actions that consume RNG numbers are: opening menus that change the screen display (like CONFIG, STATS, COMP), using spells, summoning demons, fighting, talking and walking. However, these actions only consume RNG if you can encounter any demons in the area.</p>

<p>This manip relies on hitting a specific frame when starting a new savefile. In order to do so more easily, already have the two saveslots with previous savefiles recorded. Turn on the console and, as the titlescreen shows up, soft reset. Then press B at the correct frame on the load-save screen.</p>

<p>To keep the manip going, simply execute all the actions as below. If you perform any battle action or walk any extra step then you'll have a different result than the expected, resulting in the manip ending. There are areas in which no encounters spawn so those don't consume RNG numbers - Valhalla in the beginning of the game, for example, has a lot of encounterless overworld areas. However, boss fights, such as Red Bear, Basilisk, King Frost and Betelgeuse, which are all manipped, not only rely on the RNG value, that determines their actions, but also the moon age, which determines their strength. If they deal any different damage on the party, that results in a different resulting RNG value. So, even in encounterless areas, you always have to move the same way to reach the required moon age.</p>

<p>This is probably the only hard part of the manip - the movement. I recommend watching my PBs to see the way that I moved in the overworld. The manip officially ends after the Zayn fight which encompasses for an whole hour of manipped fun and games.</p>

<p>These notes do not include general actions to what you need to do and where you need to go in the speedrun - what's included are the correct RNG consuming actions to result in the predicted outcomes, such as recruiting all the required demons and defeating the boss fights.</p>
<p>Below are the actual manip notes:</p><p></p>
